## 🚀 About Nodule Robotics

**Nodule Robotics** is an open robotics engineering initiative focused on building **modular, scalable and production-oriented robotics systems**.

Our work is inspired by:
- automotive-grade embedded systems
- ECU-based architectures
- long-term maintainability requirements
- clear hardware / software separation

We believe robotics systems should be:
- **composable**
- **deterministic**
- **understandable**
- **deployable in the real world**

## 🧩 The NODAL Framework

At the core of Nodule Robotics lies **NODAL**, a modular robotics framework.

> **NODAL is to robotics what the ECU is to automotive.**

NODAL provides:
- a modular system architecture
- strictly defined interfaces between components
- predictable lifecycle management
- a clear separation of responsibilities

Each robotics system is built by composing **independent NODAL modules**, just like ECUs in a vehicle.

## 🏗️ Repository Structure

This organization is structured around **clear responsibility boundaries**:

### 🔹 Core & Governance
- **`nodal-workspace`**  
  Framework integration, global architecture, governance, standards

### 🔹 Modules
- **`nodal-*` repositories**  
  Independent functional modules (control, sensing, communication, etc.)

### 🔹 Hardware
- **`nodal-hardware-*` repositories**  
  Reference designs, electronics, schematics, and hardware interfaces

### 🔹 Tooling & Utilities
- Build tools, simulators, validation utilities

## 🔌 Who Is This For?

Nodule Robotics and NODAL are designed for:

- 🤖 Robotics engineers
- 🔧 Embedded & systems engineers
- 🧠 Researchers & advanced makers
- 🏭 Industrial & professional robotics projects

This is **not** a toy framework — it is designed for **serious, long-term systems**.
