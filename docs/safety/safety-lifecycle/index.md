# Safety Lifecycle

## Status

Normative — Workspace level

## Purpose

This section defines **how safety activities are integrated into each phase of the system lifecycle** and how safety assurance is progressively built from concept through deployment.

The safety lifecycle is not separate from the engineering lifecycle — it is **embedded within it**. 

This section ensures that: 

* safety is addressed at every phase
* safety evidence accumulates progressively
* decisions at each phase are auditable and traceable
* deployment is preceded by complete safety validation

---

## Scope

The safety lifecycle applies to: 

* system-level safety activities
* hazard management across phases
* safety requirement implementation and verification
* risk acceptance and deployment

It does **not** prescribe: 

* module-internal safety workflows
* detailed tool configurations
* project-specific scheduling

## Core Principle:  Safety by Construction

Safety is not added at the end. 

Instead, safety is **built continuously** across the lifecycle:
