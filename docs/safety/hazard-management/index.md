# Hazard Management

## Purpose

This section defines the **hazard management process** used within the  NODAL safety framework.

Its objective is to ensure that hazards are:

* systematically identified
* consistently classified
* appropriately mitigated
* explicitly accepted when residual risk remains

Hazard management is a **continuous activity** throughout the lifecycle.

---

## Scope

The hazard management process applies to:

* system-level hazards
* hazards arising from cross-module interactions
* hazards introduced by architectural or tooling decisions

Module-level hazard analyses may exist but must be **compatible with this process**.

---

## Definition of a Hazard

A hazard is defined as:

> A potential source of harm arising from system behavior, failure, misuse, or interaction with its environment.

Hazards may be:

* functional
* architectural
* operational
* organizational

---

## Hazard Management Lifecycle

Hazard management follows a structured lifecycle:

1. **Hazard Identification**

   * identification of potential hazards
   * documentation of triggering conditions

2. **Risk Classification**

   * estimation of severity
   * estimation of likelihood
   * assignment of a risk level

3. **Mitigation Definition**

   * definition of safety measures
   * allocation to system or modules

4. **Verification**

   * demonstration that mitigations are effective

5. **Risk Acceptance**

   * explicit acceptance of residual risk
   * formal approval by Safety Authority

---

## Relationship With Safety Requirements

Hazards are transformed into:

* safety requirements
* architectural constraints
* operational limitations

Every safety requirement must be traceable to at least one hazard.

---

## Hazard Representation

Hazards are represented as:

* GitHub issues
* classified using project fields
* linked to:

  * safety requirements
  * implementation issues
  * verification evidence

This ensures live traceability and auditability.

---

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Contributors

* identify and report hazards
* provide context and assumptions

---

### Maintainers

* review hazard descriptions
* ensure correct classification

---

### Safety Authority

* validates hazard classification
* approves mitigation strategies
* accepts residual risk

---

## Escalation Rules

If a hazard:

* cannot be adequately mitigated
* exceeds acceptable risk thresholds

Then:

* the issue must be escalated
* architectural decisions may be required
* deployment may be blocked

---

## Relationship With Lifecycle

Hazard management is aligned with the lifecycle:

* Analysis → hazard identification
* Development → mitigation implementation
* Verification → mitigation validation
* Deployment → risk acceptance

Each document defines normative rules for its respective step.
