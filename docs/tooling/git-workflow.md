# Git Workflow

This document defines how Git is used within the Nodalworkspace.

---

## 🔗 Normative Reference

The authoritative Git workflow is defined in:

➡️ `/git.md` (repository root)

This document **does not redefine** Git rules.
It clarifies their **role within the tooling ecosystem**.

## 🧠 Why Git Is Tooling

Git history is considered:

- a design artifact
- a traceability mechanism
- a safety-relevant object

Git misuse directly impacts:
- auditability
- regression analysis
- certification readiness

---

## 🛡️ Safety Constraint

All safety-related changes must comply with the Git rules defined in `git.md`.

Deviation is not permitted without explicit governance approval.
