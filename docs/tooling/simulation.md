# Simulation Tooling

This document defines how simulation is used within the NODAL ecosystem.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Simulation supports:

- early validation
- risk reduction
- development acceleration

Simulation is not a replacement for verification unless explicitly stated.

---

## 🧠 Rules

- Simulation assumptions must be documented
- Models must be version-controlled
- Outputs must be reproducible

---

## 🛡️ Safety Use

Simulation results may be used as evidence if:

- the model is justified
- limitations are documented
- results are reproducible
