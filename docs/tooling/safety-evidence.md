# Tooling and Safety Evidence

This document defines how engineering tooling produces valid safety evidence.

---

## Scope

This document applies to all tools used to:
- verify safety requirements
- support safety claims

---

## Tool Classification

Tools are classified as:
- Safety-Critical
- Safety-Support
- Informational

Each tool must be classified before being used as evidence source.

---

## Evidence Validity Criteria

A tooling output is considered valid evidence if:
- it is reproducible
- it is traceable to a commit
- it is linked to a safety requirement
- it is generated by a documented tool

---

## Evidence Storage

Evidence must be:
- versioned
- preserved
- accessible for audit

---

## Governance

Changes to safety-relevant tooling require:
- impact analysis
- review
- traceability update
